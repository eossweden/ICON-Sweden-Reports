# ICON Sweden: Regular and ad-hoc Reports

We are creating regular and ad-hoc reports on
* our progress,
* "some" of the activities (not all),
* as well as the status of ICON Blockchain ecosystem (in general as needed).

We already have several social media channels where we publish reports and videos regarding different aspects of the Blockchain Technology, including trends and latest happenings. See: https://eossweden.eu/social/
